                    Well, I really liked the works chosen by my friends, especially that of lovers. Although I could notice a special admiration or taste for the works of Frida Khalo. Personally, I don't like his works so much but I could see that my friends do. But thanks to his exhibitions I was able to analyze the works in a better way, as well as being able to make a deeper analysis of them. I really liked Van Gohg's starry night show, it is my favorite work of all history, I know it is not the most technical, but it reflects a lot for me and what I am, I love it.

                    Well, this progress was quite nice for me because I was the first in college, so I was able to meet people from different ways of seeing things, and among those things is art, I really liked what is about the subject is very entertaining and It helps me to awaken that artistic side that I thought was asleep. It was incredible for me to even make this portfolio since I was able to test my artistic and technical skills in programming and in art.
