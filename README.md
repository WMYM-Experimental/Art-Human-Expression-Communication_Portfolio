# Art-Human-Expression-Communication_Portfolio

## NOT FINISHED YET - But u can see the current deployment already

In college i have an art class "Art-Human-Expression-Communication" my teacher required me a portfolio where i will have to upload all my projects related to this art subject.

By making this website by myself (without using "Canva" or any other type of web page creation software by blocks) I will be able to improve technical and artistic skills at the same time.

PD. I really enjoy this project C:

### Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Important Aspects

- This is a fully responsive site
- im going to be modifying the website until 02/2002
- Am gona update some features in the future... Add animations, etc...
