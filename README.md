# Art-Human-Expression-Communication_Portfolio

In college i have an art class "Art-Human-Expression-Communication" my teacher required a portfolio where we will upload all our projects related to this art subject.
By making my website myself (without using "Canva" or any other type of web page creation software by clicks) I will be able to improve technical and artistic skills at the same time.
