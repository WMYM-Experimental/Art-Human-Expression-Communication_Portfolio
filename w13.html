                    What impact could your creative work have on society?

                <p>
                    I don't know if my creative work could have a reallyinpact on society or maybe yes. I depends on
                    what craetive works we are talking about if it in only refering to my art process I belive no
                    because i write some stories sometimes, i usually draw and i make some art on digitals platforms.
                    Also i do photography. But i that stuff for <b>Me</b> i usually dont like to share those things
                    cause i don't have people who are interested in those things.
                    <br>
                    But there are anoher creative work i do and it is more relationate to tech. I like to do creative
                    things with tech and i think that stuff could have an impact on society. But those processes usually
                    are not related to art.

                    <br><br>
                    The videos of this week were really useful and powerful
                    <br><br>
                    Those videos were so important cause the speakers show us how important art is on society
                    and in history.
                    How we all can go down in history with our creativity and the art of that processes.
                    As well the videos show how some people do process of art and creativity with small things and that
                    is very useful to see because is inspiring to me to continue with my creative work even if it seems
                    small or useless.

                    I strongly can say <b>YES</b> it happened in the past.
                    Why not in the present to make a better future?
                    Im sure it, even more. It will.
