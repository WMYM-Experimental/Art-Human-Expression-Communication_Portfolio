                    Weekly Video Summary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The video show us some wortk about art apropiation, it's ok but I still think there is something
                    wrong with a society that
                    keeps remixing over and over again, rebooting, revisiting and producing sequels and prequels because
                    it's unable or unwilling to create its own
                    original artwork.
                    God knows many artists work hard and make very little money. Isn't their
                    labour worth a salary? Should we be allowed to steal it as much as we like? Also, a remix artist is
                    sure to succeed because the material he is using has already succeeded massively and is familiar to
                    people. Those mashups artists already has an audience.
                    Perhaps, i like the idea of resalt the best of humanity creativity by doing this kind of stuff.

                    what about remakes of certain movies?

                    <br><br>
                    Release covers, remixes, edits or simply take more than 10 seconds from a song in a audiovisual
                    material
                    could bring the djs a lot of troubles and legal problems. It is a theme refered more to laws than
                    art.
                    I think everyone have to give credit to a another person work, specially in song cause they are a
                    expression of art and art is creativity, it is mind even someone i could consider my art as me.

                    Talking about movies i think that is not to much problem. legal stuff i usually no a problem and i
                    belive that is a way for new generations to look back in art history.
