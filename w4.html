                    This week's videos show us the way humans found art.
                    And also these videos, show how the brain work for understanding what to select to be art.
                    Is very interesting i never thought about it.
                    The videos tells about how people interpret the beauty of things and how we relationate that with
                    art.

                    Weekly Video Questions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <br><br>
                    This week's videos show us the importance of art. Is it necessary for something to be beautiful to
                    be considered art?
                    Why or why not?
                    <br><br>
                    I don't think something has to be beautiful to be considered art. And in fact, how are we going to
                    define beauty, do
                    they go hand in hand? Putting these two concepts in a single question brings up more questions
                    without many answers. In
                    my case and my definition of beauty and art. Something, it does not need to be considered beautiful
                    to be art, I
                    consider art a mathematical expression. It is beautiful, it may be how I could not. Dali works are
                    considered art, are
                    they beautiful? some, yes. I think that art goes in another direction of perception a little
                    different from beauty,
                    although sometimes, they can go hand in hand.

                <p>
                    Observe: You can see melted clocks, a sea without waves, ants, a plate, a mountain, the sky, a tree
                    on a specide of
                    rectangular elevation and a kind of blanket.
                    <br><br>
                    Perceive: the perceptions obtained are: L of a rough, bitter, gloomy work, mystery, fear, unknown
                    environment, anguish,
                    loneliness.
                    <br><br>
                    Question: Why the melted clocks, what makes a blanket there, what the ants represent, why a sea
                    without waves, why the
                    tree is cut down?
                    <br><br>
                    Reflect: Melting clocks represent the time that passes differently. These clocks have different
                    markings, as their
                    pointers are melted and suggest a distorted notion of time.
                    <br><br>
                    Know: Salvador Dal√≠ did not like ants very much and he used to use them as a symbol of putrefaction
                    in his works. In the
                    background a landscape that corresponds to some coastal cliffs of Catalonia
