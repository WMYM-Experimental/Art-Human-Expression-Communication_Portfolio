                    Well, I really liked the works done by my friends. Although I could
                    notice a special taste for music in english wich is good.
                    Personally, I like their
                    works so much i love to listen music in english too.
                    With the exhibitions I was able to
                    analyze those songs and mine in a better way, as well as being able to make a deeper analysis of
                    them. I really
                    liked all songs. (But my group's was the best).
                    I know it is not the most
                    technical or worked song, but it reflects a lot from me and what I love.

                    Well, this progress was niceier for me because I could do more work mith my friends and a song. I
                    was able discover
                    people who likes art as much as me, and among those things is art and music. I really liked what is
                    going the subject is very entertaining and It helps me to awaken that artistic side of me that I
                    thought
                    was asleep. It was incredible for me to even improve this portfolio since I was able to grow up
                    my artistic and programming skills.

                    Put this picture cause i love it.

                    the technological development of the world is fundamental not only for the technical aspects but
                    also for art and these two processes when using creative processes have a strong connection that
                    makes them necessary for each other. It can also be said that thanks to the creative processes
                    provided by art we can improve creative processes for things that are not very artistic.
                    <br>
                    What is the role of technology in art? Is it a benefit/advancement? Why?
                    <br>
                    I believe that art and technology go hand in hand cannot advance alone, they are needed. I also
                    believe that technology is a fundamental piece of art. Before you could not use purple color because
                    it is expensive and difficult to extract and now with an editing program we can fill a screen with
                    purple. We don't even need pigment
