                    In which spaces could I spread my artistic product and why?
                    <br>
                    I think that the most convenient thing is to spread the work on networks since it can reach more
                    people with which more people can appreciate the work
                    <br></br>
                    What kind of audiences is it aimed at and why?
                    <br>
                    I believe that my artistic product is directed towards all types of public. We all have a mother,
                    living or dead, but there is such love.

                <p>
                    What is the value of artists in society?
                    <br>
                    The role of the artist in society I would say it would be for me:
                    The author of a work that is given an appreciative and very important value for society, they are
                    the soul of art because they have an extraordinary imagination and the ability to capture the image
                    in their mind to create their own work of art, therefore it is important that we respect their work
                    and value them for what they are, the soul of the culture.
                    <br></br>
                    What can we do to help artists find a decent space in society?
                    <br>
                    For example, in the economic sense, it would be: making donations, attending their concerts, sharing
                    with others the taste for their music, in the case of records, buying their songs, their art. And
                    more in depth would be in educational matters, educating the population that this type of creative
                    people exists and that they are necessary. However, I believe that those who seek their space earn
                    it.
